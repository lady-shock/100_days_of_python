Modulo exercise:

1) your bus arrives every 17 minutes starting at midnight. It's 4 am. What time does the next bus arrive?
2) open your REPL. Using a seed of 42, create 2 random numbers from 0 to 100 (including 100),  call them a and b. create a third random number M from 2 to 10, inclusive.
   
Modern cryptography uses very large number for security. Raising one huge number to the power of another huge number can take a long time.  Maybe there's a better way...

3) what is a % M? what is b % M?
4) what is (a * b ) % M?
5) what is (a % M) * (b % M)?   Hmm....
6) without using python or a calculator, what is (545679844 * 323343531) % 5?
7) what is (a ** b) % M?
8) what is (a % M ** b %M)?  hmm...
9) without using python or a calculator,  what is (54094543425679844 ** 32399434322343531) % 5?

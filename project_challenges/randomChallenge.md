Some random random exercises:
This is long, but should be quite easy.

open your REPL and enter-

import random

1) using the random.randrange() function-print a random number from 0 to 100, including the possibility of choosing 100.
2) do that again
3) and again
4) and again
5) did you know that on most platforms, while in the REPL the up arrow key repeats the last command?
6) do it again. 
7) Enough of that- using the seed function, seed your random number generator with the number 42
8) print a random even number between -1 and 101
9) do it again
10) again
11) one more time
12) now repeat the seed with the number 42
13) print a random even number between -1 and 101
14) again
15) again
16) and again
17) what do you notice?
18) now enter `random.seed()` With nothing in the parentheses What do you think this does?
19) print a random even number between -1 and 101
20) again
21) again
22) again
23) now what do you think #18 did?
24) create a new variable and assign it to a string ten characters long
25) using the string indexing (for example string[0] gives the first character of the string) write code that picks a random letter from your string and prints it. Run this enough times to make sure you print all the letters.

Project Challenge: 
Build a casino. 

We’ll start with everybody’s favorite, the roulette wheel. 
In roulette, a ball is dropped onto a spinning wheel with 38 slots (we’re in Vegas, so American roulette). When the wheel stops, the ball comes to rest in one of the slots. 
The slots are numbered 1-36 with odd numbers being red and even black. 
In addition, there are two green slots labeled 0 and 00.
Players predict where the ball will land. There are many betting options, but for now, let’s let the player choose a single number (pays 35:1 if they win - a $1 bet wins $35 so now you have $36), red or black (pays 1:1, a $1 bet pays $1 and now you have $2) or green (pays 17:1)

To simulate the roulette table, your program should
1) give your player a starting amount of money in the currency of your choosing. You must include the appropriate currency symbol. (Consider using two variables, one the currency character, the other a number for the amount and printing the two together)
2) print how much the player stats with, for example $100
3) request user input of the amount of the bet and what bet is being placed. 
4) simulate a spin of the wheel
5) output the wheel result and announce whether the player won or lost and how much 
6) output to tell the player how much they now have (include currency symbol)

For now, that’s enough. Remember you need only simulate one spin. Next step we will add a loop to allow the player to place another bet or quit.

# 100 Days of Python
Intended as a repositiory of helpful material for the 100 days of python whatsapp group. Materials may be used freely. 

## Contents
- **notes:** in here are contained python programming notes as posted previously within the chat.
- **project_challenges: **here find exercises, challenges and larger projects, also as previously posted
- **AUTOMATE-THE-BORING-STUFF:** and excellent ebook by Al Sweigert which starts with the very basics of python and then goes directly into very useful real world applications. Highly recommended (and freely distributed)
- **READ.md:** what you are reading now. 
- **Syllabus-for-100-days-ofPython.pdf:** The syllabus on which our group is loosely based. This comes form an excellent Udemy course of the same name. Although at first had intended to mirror the course, the "bootcamp" approach was too fast. So we are covering the same topics in roughly the same order but at a much slower pace
